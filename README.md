# PiArchiver
Sometimes you visit a website and the information on that site is very interesting to you, you bookmarked it, and by the time, your bookmarks growing too many, you cannot remember them, just remember a a little bit of content and need a full text search on website content to retrieve them . To manage all content of bookmarks and able to retrieve them later, so I built this project as an assistant tool to help me manage all my favourite websites. This project helps me save my bookmarked websites onto cloud and full text search on content of bookmarked websites. I made an extension for chrome browser to save my favourite bookmarks, then all these bookmarks will store onto cloud (Google app engine) so that I can see these bookmarks across computers (at home and workplace). I built a local service will sync bookmark with cloud, and this service will pass the content of websites to elastic search for indexing and able to full text search later.
